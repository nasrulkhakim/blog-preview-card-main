# About me

Hello everyone!

I’m Nasrul Khakim, an aspiring product designer from Indonesia. I’ve been learning programming, self - directed, for few months now. I’m using great free resources on the internet, I’ll put down some of them below.

It’s quite challenging learning to program as an adult, since I have business to run daily and quite frankly it’s not easy to find the time to learn new skill. Other than that, I’ve never been exposed to this kind of technology before.

For those of you alike, lets do this together. I’m open to any discussion especially things related to programming or technology in general.

Check out my other repos, and feel free to give me some feedback, that’d be really helpful for us.
